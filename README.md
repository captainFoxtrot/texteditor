# texteditor
 Work-in-progress, terminal-based text editor written in C. 

## Usage

- Start the editor by typing `make run`; to open a file, type `make run FILENAME=path/to/file`.
- To re-compile the program without running it, simply type `make`.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the cursor.
- To save a file, simply hit `F1`.
- To close the editor, type `Ctrl+C`.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible should this program corrupt any of your files (the chance of this happening is almost zero, though you can examine the source code if you like.)
